            <p class="description">Abalone Surf Shop is a family owned and operated surf shop, but we're more than that. Abalone has become a place to gather, to show art and to meet people as well as to buy boards and other surf accessories. We focus on building a community of like-minded people who like to make things, go places, and have good times. Stop on by the shop to say hi!  </p>
