                  <img class="boardimages" src="mitsven-b-tail.jpg" alt="5 foot 10 inches Mitsven B Tail board leaning against wall">
                  <p> The B-tail thruster has the speed and planning of a fish surfboard but is much more fluid and maneuverable as well as much better performing top to bottom on the face of the wave. This model features a wider nose, relaxed rocker, a single to double concave bottom contour, and Mitsven’s own rail style. The result is a super fast, user friendly board that performs way better than your fish.</p>

                  <img class="boardimages" src="mitsven-fish.jpg" alt="5 foot 10 inches Mitsven Fish board leaning against wall">
                  <p>We asked Bob Mitsven to send us a couple twin keels with pulled in tails for maneuverability in tight spaces. The rails are slightly turned up, offering a delicious edge for bottom and top turns. These boards will work in a variety of conditions and will have you grinning when the waves are sub-par or straight firing!</p>

                  <img class="boardimages" src="furrow-olivella.jpg" alt="5 foot 8 inches Furrow Olivella board leaning against wall">
                  <p>A wide nose round pintail model. Named after the Olivella shells that cover our local coastline in the winter, the Olivella is a fast, little pocket board that loves mushy chop to lined up clean waves.</p>

                  <img class="boardimages" src="tyler-warren-dream-fish.jpg" alt="5 foot 9 inches Tyler Warren Dream fish board leaning against wall">
                  <p>Influenced by the San Diego fish design. A classic replica with a modern foil and feel. This board is fast, loose and takes you back to the basics. Speed, trim and maneuverability.</p>

                  <img class="boardimages" src="radio-plane-jane.jpg" alt="6 foot 2 inches Radio Plane Jane board leaning against wall">
                  <p>Radio Surfboards are master designs created by Allan Gibbons for Mollusk. This one is a fast drivey thruster for sub-par to good days in the waist-to-head high range. Fun in the pocket or even hunting down an air section. Guaranteed speed and drive throughout turns will have you questioning if this board is really even a plane jane in the first place. </p>

                  <p>“The Spitfire Egg is a board I’ve had in my quiver since 1970. Over the years, I’ve worked with many great shapers to update the rocker, foil, and curves to keep a clean and simple user friendly hull.” - Kirk Putnam</p>

                  <p>Ahhh, the long fish. The agility of a fish with a lot more trim and paddle power. Long fish are a shop favorite.</p>

                  <img class="boardimages" src="furrow-stubbie.jpg" alt="7 foot 2 inches Furrow Stubbie board leaning against wall">
                  <p>Extremely versatile Hull that utilizes rolled entry to spiral vee out the tail. This board is a far more user-friendly and traditionally shredder feeling hull than many of the other ones we have in the shop, but still utilizes rail work and the ball bearing feeling all of us love. Not your ordinary jelly bean!</p>

                  <p>A wide point forward design for trim and speed with a swallowed spiral v to break up the tail. Now... Who wants to go fast?</p>

                  <img class="boardimages" src="mitsven-egg.jpg" alt="7 foot 8 inches Mitsven Egg board leaning against wall">
                  <p>This Bob Mitsven egg is beauty, built for speed with Skip Frye-esque rails allowing for ultimate trimming. It's a stripped down business orientated board for people concerned with trim and engaging the rail. This board is 100% hand built with predominate down rails, it still has a good amount of up turn making for well defined sharp edge.</p>
