                        <h2>5'9" Tyler Warren Fish</h2>
                        <p> $1570</p>
                        <p> Influenced by the San Diego fish design. A classic replica with a modern foil and feel. This board is fast, loose, and takes you back to the basics. Speed, trim, and maneuverability.</p>

                        <p>$1830</p>
                        <p>The bomber is a classic style nose rider with foiled rails and a gradual tail lift, settle concave and a more down rail in the nose to help create lift.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p>$1295</p>
                        <p>We asked Bob Mitsven to send us a couple twin keels with pulled in tails for maneuverability in tight spaces. The rails are slightly turned up, offering a delicious edge for bottom and top turns. These boards will work in a variety of conditions and will have you grinning when the waves are sub-par or straight firing!</p>

                        <p>$1170</p>
                        <p>Do you believe in Magic?</p>

                        <p>$1015</p>
                        <p>Extremely versatile Hull that utilizes rolled entry to spiral vee out the tail. This board is a far more user-friendly and traditionally shredder feeling hull than many of the other ones we have in the shop, but still utilizes rail work and the ball bearing feeling all of us love. Not your ordinary jelly bean!</p>

                        <h2>6'0" Christian Beamish Old School Twin</h2>
                        <p>$960</p>
                        <p>"Old School Twins" break into two groups: 6'4" and under, and 6'6" and up. The shorter Twinnies are whip-sharp and fast, with surprising hold and drive when the surfer lays into turns with heavily planted feet and a buried rail. If the boards are surfed in a "flicky" manner, they tend to skate and slide (which can be fun and have its place), but they come alive when a rider gets over the board with his or her weight and drives hard.</p>

                        <h2>9'4" Elmore Sam's Club</h2>
                        <p>$1535</p>
                        <p> The Sam's Club is the perfect all-around log with a "Sam-style" outline. It has a slightly pulled in nose and tail block, yet a nice middle width. It has a gentle nose concave that transcends into a gentle roll through the middle and out the tail, allowing for a multifaceted longboard that turns well off the tail and provides stability on the nose. This is a versatile log that works great regardless of the style of wave you surf consistently (beach, point, reef, etc.)</p>

                        <p>$1495</p>
                        <p> The Hotdog is a David Nuuhiwa inspired nose rider. This board has a flat nose rocker and deep concave, 50/50 rails and a little extra tail kick, this board provides an extremely stable nose ride and smooth pivoting turns </p>
