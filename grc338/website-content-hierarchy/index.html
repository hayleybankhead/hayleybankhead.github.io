            <p>Abalone Surf Shop is a family owned and operated surf shop, but we're more than that. Abalone has become a place to gather, to show art and to meet people as well as to buy boards and other surf stuff. We focus on building a community of like minded people who like to make things, go places, and have good times. Stop on by the shop to say hello, you never know what kind of antics you'll get into.  </p>
