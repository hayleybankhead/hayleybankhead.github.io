            <h1>Boards</h1>
            <p>We carry a large selection of surfboards to fit a wide variety of surfing conditions </p>
            <h2>Shortboards</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h3>5'9" Tyler Warren Fish</h3>
                  <p> $1570</p>
                  <p> Influenced by the San Diego fish design. A classic replica with a modern foil and feel. This board is fast, loose, and takes you back to the basics. Speed, trim, and maneuverability.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>5'2" Mistven Fish</h3>
                  <p>$1295</p>
                  <p>We asked Bob Mitsven to send us a couple twin keels with pulled in tails for maneuverability in tight spaces. The rails are slightly turned up, offering a delicious edge for bottom and top turns. These boards will work in a variety of conditions and will have you grinning when the waves are sub-par or straight firing!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>6'0" Christian Beamish Old School Twin</h3>
                  <p>$960</p>
                  <p>"Old School Twins" break into two groups: 6'4" and under, and 6'6" and up. The shorter Twinnies are whip-sharp and fast, with surprising hold and drive when the surfer lays into turns with heavily planted feet and a buried rail. If the boards are surfed in a "flicky" manner, they tend to skate and slide (which can be fun and have its place), but they come alive when a rider gets over the board with his or her weight and drives hard.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>5'8" Furrow Olivella</h3>
                  <p>$1185</p>
                  <p>A wide nose round pintail model. Named after the Olivella shells that cover our local coastline in the winter, the Olivella is a fast, little pocket board that loves mushy chop to lined up clean waves.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>5'9" Tyler Warren Dream Fish</h3>
                  <p>$1245</p>
                  <p>Influenced by the San Diego fish design. A classic replica with a modern foil and feel. This board is fast, loose and takes you back to the basics. Speed, trim and maneuverability.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>6'2" Radio Plane Jane</h3>
                  <p>$755</p>
                  <p>Radio Surfboards are master designs created by Allan Gibbons for Mollusk. This one is a fast drivey thruster for sub-par to good days in the waist-to-head high range. Fun in the pocket or even hunting down an air section. Guaranteed speed and drive throughout turns will have you questioning if this board is really even a plane jane in the first place. </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Mid Lengths</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h3>7'6" MPE Spitfire</h3>
                  <p>$850</p>
                  <p>"The Spitfire Egg is a board I’ve had in my quiver since 1970. Over the years, I’ve worked with many great shapers to update the rocker, foil, and curves to keep a clean and simple user friendly hull." - Kirk Putnam</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>6'6" Weston Guppy</h3>
                  <p>$940</p>
                  <p>Ahhh, the long fish. The agility of a fish with a lot more trim and paddle power. Long fish are a shop favorite.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>7'2" Furrow Stubbie</h3>
                  <p>$1015</p>
                  <p>Extremely versatile Hull that utilizes rolled entry to spiral vee out the tail. This board is a far more user-friendly and traditionally shredder feeling hull than many of the other ones we have in the shop, but still utilizes rail work and the ball bearing feeling all of us love. Not your ordinary jelly bean!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>7'6" Mistven Magic</h3>
                  <p>$1170</p>
                  <p>Do you believe in Magic?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>8'0" Weston Goodfoot</h3>
                  <p>$1090</p>
                  <p>A wave catching machine that will get you on the Good Foot!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>6'6" Mitsven Tri Fin Swallow</h3>
                  <p>$1210</p>
                  <p>A wide point forward design for trim and speed with a swallowed spiral v to break up the tail. Now... Who wants to go fast?</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>6'8" Mitsven Egg</h3>
                  <p>$1350</p>
                  <p>This Bob Mitsven egg is beauty, built for speed with Skip Frye-esque rails allowing for ultimate trimming. It's a stripped down business orientated board for people concerned with trim and engaging the rail. This board is 100% hand built with predominate down rails, it still has a good amount of up turn making for well defined sharp edge.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Longboards</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'6" Elmore Hotdog</h3>
                  <p>$1495</p>
                  <p> The Hotdog is a David Nuuhiwa inspired nose rider. This board has a flat nose rocker and deep concave, 50/50 rails and a little extra tail kick, this board provides an extremely stable nose ride and smooth pivoting turns </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'4" Elmore Sam's Club</h3>
                  <p>$1535</p>
                  <p> The Sam's Club is the perfect all-around log with a "Sam-style" outline. It has a slightly pulled in nose and tail block, yet a nice middle width. It has a gentle nose concave that transcends into a gentle roll through the middle and out the tail, allowing for a multifaceted longboard that turns well off the tail and provides stability on the nose. This is a versatile log that works great regardless of the style of wave you surf consistently (beach, point, reef, etc.)</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'2" Tyler Warren Transistion</h3>
                  <p>$1830</p>
                  <p>The bomber is a classic style nose rider with foiled rails and a gradual tail lift, settle concave and a more down rail in the nose to help create lift.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'4" MPE Ruler</h3>
                  <p>$950</p>
                  <p>"I worked on the Ruler with Michael Saggus from Australia. It's a good, all around, traditional longboard: full hip outline, slight nose concave, and pinched rails. Great for anybody who appreciates traditional longboarding style." - Kirk Putnam</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'6" Mitsven Modern Classic</h3>
                  <p>$1390</p>
                  <p>The name says it all. A modernized version of a square tail Log. Speed, Flow, and Versatility. 100% Hand shaped and glassed. It should be a illegal to get a longboard from master Bob Mitsven at this price!</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'0" Anderson Farberow I</h3>
                  <p>$1475</p>
                  <p>This board works in everything—from bigger bombs at the top of the point to ankle slappers on the inside. Crank a smooth cutty on this pintail noserider. Deep nose concave for the tip time, pinched rails for the mid-board carves.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h3>9'6" Tyler AWarren David Edwards</h3>
                  <p>$1820</p>
                  <p>This board is a combination of the glide of a Phil Edwards and the noseriding capabilities of David Nuuhiwa noserider. A stable platform for logging.</p>
