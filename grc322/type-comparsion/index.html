        <h1> Futura vs. Mr Eaves Modern </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Futura</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Futura is a simple and geometric sans serif font that was designed by Paul Renner in 1927 in Frankfurt, Germany at the Bauer Type Foundry. Renner designed this sans-serif to be low in contrast unlike other sans-serifs of the time. There are tall ascenders for lowercase letters and uppercase letters are like Roman Capitals. Similar to the Bauhaus design style of the time, Futura utilizes the shape of the circle a lot throughout its design as well as other geometric shapes. Bauer marketed the Futura as “the typeface of our time” (translated from German) and “the typeface of today and tomorrow”.  At the time Futura stood out against the more elaborate and decorative handwritten-style typefaces and it in fact eliminated all non essential elements. Companies such as IKEA, Volkswagen, and Supreme use this typeface for their logo which goes to show its diversity and relevance still today. In addition to logo usage, Futura can be used as a display or paragraph font. </p>
             
			 <h3>Mr Eaves Modern</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Mr. Eaves Modern was designed by Zuzano Licko in 2009 as the sans serif companion to Mrs. Eaves and was an addition to the Emigre Type Library. Zuzana started Émigré with her husband in 1984 as a magazine and type foundry.  Licko did create some unique characteristics so that the transition to a sans-serif would look right and not just like the serifs had been chopped off. Mr Eves Mod. boasts a small x-height, has extended ascenders and descenders, details on the flags and tails, as well as a decrease in contrast compared to Mrs Eaves. While it was based on the proportions of Mrs. Eaves, without the serifs, the set width is slightly narrower. </p>
