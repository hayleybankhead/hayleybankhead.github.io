Stylemaster Harrison Roach and previous world champ Soleil Errico perched their way to wins, beating out log lords like Kaniela Stewart and Kelis Kaleopa’a and Sophia Culhane in the process.

                                    Over the past few weeks, as new COVID-19 cases rise in some areas and fall in others, leaders in various parts of the world are discussing opening their borders to travelers. As of this writing, France is allowing in residents of EU countries with low numbers of COVID cases and by July 1, the country will be open to international travelers from countries where the epidemic is under control.

                                    On a huge day at Waimea Bay in the early 1970s, filmmakers Jack McCoy and Dick Hoole needed an additional photographer to shoot from land as they filmed in the water. They handed Shirley Rogers, a young woman from Ewa Beach barely out of high school, a Century 650mm lens and asked if she could help.

                                <p>
                                   Back in October of 2020, German hellman Sebastian Steudtner clocked a ginormous monstrosity at Nazare and now–18 months later-he’s officially nabbed the Guinness World Record title for the “Biggest Wave Ever Surfed”. By somewhat rough calculations, the wave reached 86 feet high and will now live on in the record books.

                                    The pursuit of a college degree may not seem like the most practical way to chase surf, binding yourself to one location for an extended period of time and saddling yourself with tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt just to postpone your eventual entry into the Rat Race in service of paying down your federally subsidized debt.
